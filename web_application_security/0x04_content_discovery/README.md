Tasks
0. Manual Discovery - Secrets in Plain Sight
mandatory
Dive into the art of content discovery by exploring often overlooked files that can be treasure troves of information: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and favicon analysis.
Your mission is to uncover a hidden endpoint, a concealed resource, and identify the web application framework.

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x04
Target Endpoint: http://web0x04.hbtn/
For this task you should submit your finding in the following format: - <: from robots.txt>, <: from sitemap.xml>, <: from favicon> - Example:

$ cat 0-plain_sight.txt
/wp-admin, wp-upload.php, wordpress
Useful Instructions
1. Start by navigating to `/robots.txt`. Look for Disallow entries that might hint at hidden or restricted paths. One of these paths contains your first flag.
2. Access `/sitemap.xml` next. Sitemaps are intended to help search engines index web content but can also reveal hidden resources. Find the resource that's not linked from anywhere else on the site to discover your second flag.
3. Download the site's favicon.ico and use tools or online resources like the OWASP favicon database to match it against known framework icons. Identifying the correct framework will lead you to your third flag.
4. Pay close attention to the details in each file, as they might contain direct paths or subtle hints leading to the next discovery step.
5. Utilize online tools for favicon analysis and comparison to expedite framework identification.

Gobuster is a powerful tool designed to automate the process of content discovery.
It employs various modes, making it indispensable for the modern cybersecurity toolkit.
Your quest involves mastering Gobuster‚Äôs modes to unearth hidden resources, subdomains, and much more.
We start our journey with an overview of the seven key modes Gobuster offers:

dir: A mode for classic directory brute-forcing.
dns: Brute-forces DNS subdomains.
s3: Enumerates open S3 buckets and checks for their existence and listings.
gcs: Searches for open Google Cloud Storage buckets.
vhost: Conducts brute-forcing of virtual hosts (vhosts), different from DNS subdomain searching.
fuzz: Undertakes basic fuzzing, pinpointing where a keyword (FUZZ) should be replaced.
tftp: Brute-forces TFTP file names.
This comprehensive feature set makes Gobuster adept at revealing the unseen parts of web applications and infrastructure.

Your first mission is to familiarize yourself with Gobuster‚Äôs dir mode by conducting a directory brute-force attack against a target website.
You‚Äôll leverage this mode to discover hidden directories that will return a Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è as content with Task #4 as Website title.

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x04
Target Website: http://web0x04.hbtn
Useful Instructions
1. Select a wordlist for the directory brute-forcing operation. You can use common wordlists provided by tools like `dirb` or `SecLists`.
2. Execute Gobuster in `dir` mode against the target website, specifying your chosen wordlist.
3. Analyze the output, focusing on HTTP status codes that indicate the presence of a directory (e.g., 200 OK, 403 Forbidden).
4. Document any interesting directories you discover, noting their paths and any content or functionality they reveal.

Remember:
- Experiment with different wordlists and options (e.g., specifying file extensions) to uncover as much as possible.
- Be mindful of the network and server load you're generating with your requests to ensure responsible use of the tool.
