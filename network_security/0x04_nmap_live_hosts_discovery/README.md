Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
    All your scripts will be tested on Kali Linux.
    All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
    You must substitute the IP range for $1.
    All your files should end with a new line (Why?)
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash.
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;.
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    All your files must be executable

More Info
Install nmap.

If nmap is not already installed on your terminal

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nmap

Basic usage nmap.

$ nmap <IP address>

Tasks
0. Will arp be enough ?
mandatory

Write a bash script that scan a subnetwork to discover live host using ARP scan.

    You should use nmap.
    Your code should tell nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery.
    You should run your code as privileged user. root or sudoers.
    Your script should accept a subnetwork as an arguments $1.

Depending on the scanned subnetwork, the output could change.
We can‚Äôt expect to learn about the Target MAC Address, unless we are in the the same subnetwork.

5. Are your privileged enough to scan me ?
mandatory

mandatory

Time To Ping The Target

Catch the flag time is on, here is some tips:

    You should run your scan as privileged user. root or sudoers.
